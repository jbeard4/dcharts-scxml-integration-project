The goal of this formalism is to support the following functionality:
	* support interactive simulation of DCharts models through a web interface
	* provide convenient interface to export scxml and javascript from dcharts models

This formalism brings together and depends on three separate sub-components:
	* a DCharts-to-SCXML translator
	* scxml-js (an scxml-to-javascript compiler)
	* DCharts HTTP Simulation tools
		- DCharts Debug HTTP Server
		- Simple HTTP Proxy Server
		- Generic Statechart Simulation Web Client front-end

It provides an AToM3 buttons model and helper functions that leverage the above components.
